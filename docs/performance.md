# Performance Deep Dive

This document explains why json is faster than existing parsers and the key optimizations that make it possible.

## GPU: 2x Faster than cuJSON

On NVIDIA B200 with 804MB `twitter_large_record.json`:

| Parser | Throughput | Time | Speedup |
|--------|------------|------|---------|
| cuJSON (CUDA C++) | 3.6 GB/s | 236 ms | baseline |
| **json GPU** | **7.0 GB/s** | **121 ms** | **2.0x** |

*Based on warmed-up runs. Pinned memory path (comparable scope to cuJSON).*

## Key Optimizations

| Optimization | Impact | Description |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| **GPU Stream Compaction** | 🔥 **Main speedup** | Reduces D2H transfer from ~160ms to minimal overhead |
| **Pinned Memory** | H2D: ~15ms | Uses `HostBuffer` for fast host-to-device transfer |
| **Hierarchical Prefix Sums** | GPU: efficient | Parallel scans using block primitives |
| **Fused Kernels** | Lower overhead | Single-pass quote detection + structural bitmap |

## Why json is Faster: The Stream Compaction Advantage

### The Problem with cuJSON

cuJSON transfers **all structural character data** back to CPU:

- Input: 804MB JSON file
- Structural chars: ~58% of input = **465MB transfer**
- D2H time: **~160ms** (bottleneck)

### json's Solution

json uses **GPU stream compaction** to extract only position indices:

- Input: 804MB JSON file
- Position array: ~1 million positions × 4 bytes = **4MB transfer**
- D2H time: **minimal** (116x smaller data transfer)

This is the primary reason for the 2x overall speedup.

## Detailed Timing Breakdown

### cuJSON Pipeline (~236ms total)

```
cuJSON breakdown (average):
├─ H2D transfer:       ~15 ms   (804MB → GPU)
├─ Validation:          ~2 ms   (GPU)

## Architecture Comparison

| Aspect | cuJSON | json |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Input memory** | Pinned (cudaMallocHost) | Pinned (HostBuffer) |
| **H2D transfer** | ✓ (15ms) | ✓ (15ms) |
| **GPU kernels** | Validation + Tokenization | Quote detection + Prefix sums + Bitmap |
| **Position extraction** | ❌ (transfers all data) | ✅ **GPU stream compaction** |
| **D2H transfer** | 465MB (~160ms) | 4MB (~15ms) |
| **Bracket matching** | GPU (Parser kernel) | CPU (stack algorithm) |

## Performance Metrics Explained

`pixi run bench-gpu` reports a single `std.benchmark.Bench` table with
four rows so you can see where time goes across the pipeline:

| Row | What It Includes | Use Case |
|-----|------------------|----------|
| **from host bytes: memcpy + parse (wall-clock)** | host→pinned memcpy + `parse_json_gpu_from_pinned` | Realistic "bytes in memory → parsed" cost |
| **parse_json_gpu_from_pinned (pinned, wall-clock)** | H2D + GPU kernels + stream compaction + D2H + CPU bracket matching | Apples-to-apples comparison with cuJSON (both assume pinned input) |
| **parse_json_gpu_from_pinned (device-only)** | Same call, timed via `DeviceContext.execution_time` (CUDA events) | Pure device-queue time, excludes host-side CPU post-processing |
| **loads[target='gpu']** | Everything + `Value` tree construction on CPU | Real-world application performance |

### Why Four Rows?

1. **Pinned wall-clock (~121 ms, 7.0 GB/s):** apples-to-apples with cuJSON
   (both assume pinned input). This is the headline GPU-parse number.
2. **Pinned device-only (~100 ms, ~8 GB/s):** drops the host-side
   bracket-matching and list-build work. Use this to compare against
   kernel-only timings from other frameworks.
3. **from host bytes (~280 ms, ~2.9 GB/s):** adds the realistic
   host→pinned memcpy (~120 ms for 804 MB on DDR5).
4. **Full `loads[target='gpu']` (~900 ms, ~1.0 GB/s):** adds the
   CPU-bound `Value` tree construction on top of everything.

Pass `--debug-timing` to get a per-phase breakdown (H2D, GPU kernels,
position extraction, bracket matching, total) printed alongside the
summary table:

```bash
pixi run bench-gpu -- --debug-timing benchmark/datasets/twitter_large_record.json
```

## Benchmark Results

### GPU Performance (NVIDIA B200)

**Important:** GPU benchmarks are only meaningful for large files (>100MB). For smaller files, GPU launch overhead dominates and results are not representative of actual performance.

| Dataset | Size | Pinned Path | Speedup vs cuJSON |
|---------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| twitter_large_record.json | 804 MB | 7.0 GB/s | **2.0x** |

GPU parallelism shines with large files where the overhead is amortized.

## CPU Performance

json has three CPU code paths, all served by `loads(target='cpu')`:

| Path | What it does | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **simd** (default) | SIMD stage 1 structural index + lazy `Value` (scans only the bytes the caller actually inspects) | Default. Best for partial reads (`v["users"][0]["name"]`). |
| **scalar** | Scalar stage 1 + same lazy `Value` | Fallback / debugging. Slightly slower. |
| **tape** (`-D JSON_USE_TAPE_VALUE=1`) | SIMD stage 1 + tape-emitting stage 2 (eager `Document`) | When the workload traverses everything. Slower for `bench[v.is_object()]`-style probes because it materialises the whole document up front. |
| simdjson (FFI) | C++ simdjson via the `target='cpu-simdjson'` shim | When you need an extra reference parser at the cost of FFI marshalling. |

### Real numbers (Apple Silicon, M-series, this dev box)

`pixi run bench-cpu <file>` runs `simdjson` C++ first, then the three Mojo
variants in one Bench table.

| File | Size | simdjson C++ | Mojo simd (lazy) | Mojo scalar | Mojo tape (eager) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `twitter.json` | 617 KB | 2.66 GB/s | **1.18 GB/s** | 0.60 GB/s | 0.23 GB/s |
| `citm_catalog.json` | 1.7 MB | 3.13 GB/s | **1.33 GB/s** | 0.62 GB/s | 0.23 GB/s |
| `twitter_large_record.json` | 804 MB | 1.47 GB/s | **0.73 GB/s** | 0.51 GB/s | 0.15 GB/s |

Headline: on small/medium DOM-bound payloads the Mojo SIMD path runs at
**~40–50 % of native simdjson** in pure Mojo, with no FFI; on the 804 MB
record-shaped corpus it lands at **~50 % of simdjson** (`0.73` vs
`1.47` GB/s). The tape path is intentionally eager — it pays parse-time
cost once so the `Document` is fully materialised, which makes it
slower under the bench's "parse + access top-level" workload but
roughly free for code that traverses everything afterwards.

The Mojo simd path is **~2× faster than the simdjson FFI shim** on this
hardware because it sidesteps the marshalling round-trip entirely.

## When to Use GPU vs CPU

| File Size | Recommended Backend | Reason |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| < 1 MB | **CPU (simdjson)** | GPU launch overhead dominates |
| 1-100 MB | **CPU or GPU** | Comparable performance |
| > 100 MB | **GPU** | 2x faster than cuJSON, 3-5x faster than CPU |

## Optimization Techniques

### 1. GPU Stream Compaction

**Problem:** After identifying structural characters on GPU, we need their positions on CPU for bracket matching.

**Naive approach:** Transfer entire structural character bitmap (58% of input size)

**Optimized approach:**
1. Create position bitmap on GPU
2. Use parallel prefix sum to compute output positions
3. Compact positions into dense array on GPU
4. Transfer only compact position array to CPU

**Result:** 116x reduction in D2H transfer size (465MB → 4MB)

### 2. Pinned Memory

Using `HostBuffer` (pinned memory) for H2D transfers:

- Pinned: ~15ms for 804MB
- Pageable: ~110ms for 804MB
- **Speedup:** 7.3x faster

### 3. Hierarchical Prefix Sums

For computing in-string regions, we use block-level prefix sums:

1. Each block computes local prefix sum using `block.prefix_sum`
2. Last value from each block propagates to next block
3. Single-pass algorithm, minimal synchronization

### 4. Fused Kernels

Combine multiple operations in single kernel launches:

- Quote detection + escape handling
- Structural character extraction + bitmap creation
- Reduces kernel launch overhead

### 5. Minimize Memory Allocations

- Pre-allocate GPU buffers based on input size
- Reuse `DeviceContext` across operations
- Use `String(unsafe_from_utf8=bytes^)` for bulk string construction

### 6. Hybrid GPU/CPU Pipeline

- **GPU:** Parallel bitmap operations (where GPU excels)
- **CPU:** Sequential bracket matching (where CPU is sufficient)
- **Key insight:** Don't force everything on GPU; use the right tool for each step

## Performance Variance

GPU performance can vary between runs due to:

- **Cold-start overhead:** First GPU run ~200ms slower (GPU initialization)
- **Thermal throttling:** GPU frequency varies with temperature
- **Scheduling:** CUDA stream scheduling can introduce variance

**Solution:** Always measure with warm-up runs and report averages.

## Future Optimizations

Potential improvements for even better performance:

1. **GPU bracket matching:** Could eliminate CPU bottleneck (~11ms)
2. **Multi-GPU support:** For files > 1GB
3. **Streaming parser:** Process chunks as they arrive
4. **Zero-copy Value tree:** Build tree directly on GPU memory
